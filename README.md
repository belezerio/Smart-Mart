# Smart-Mart
A marketplace where local sellers list items, and prices fluctuate based on supply/demand or time of day.

t’s an online marketplace (like a mini Amazon for a city/area) where:

Local shopkeepers/sellers can list their products.

Buyers/customers can browse and buy products.

Prices are not fixed – they change automatically based on:

How much people are viewing/adding to cart (demand)

Time of day (peak / off-peak)

Stock level (less stock → price increase)

This automatic price change is the dynamic pricing engine – that’s the unique and smart part.
